###mapit
The script gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard and opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address. 

###search
With this script, we can type a search term on the command line and have the computer automatically open a browser with all the top search results in new tabs.

###downloadComic
XKCD is a popular geek webcomic series. Downloading each comic manually would take forever, but a script can this in a couple of minutes!
